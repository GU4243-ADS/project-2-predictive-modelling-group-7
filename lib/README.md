# Project 1: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

For readability, we include the functions for our baseline and advanced models in this main portion of the lib folder. The other models we considered (CNN, SVM, MLP, logistic regression, and random forest) are in the subdirectory titled, "Other Models."
