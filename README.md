### [Project Description](doc/)

Term: Spring 2018

+ Project title: Dogs or Cats? Image Classification
+ Team Number: 7
+ Team Members: Mao Guan, Nicole Smith, Michael Sheng, Kenny Warner, and Jessica Zhang. 
+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for images of dogs versus cats. ([main.Rmd](doc/main.Rmd))
	+ Baseline model: GBM with SIFT features,  ___ % accuracy.
	+ Proposed model: XGBoost with HOG features, with 74% accuracy. 

+ Project details: We discussed several classification models including GBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, logistic regression, convolutional neural network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors, linear SVM, and RBF SVM. We also HOG and SIFT features on each of the models and compared the prediction error and computational time.
